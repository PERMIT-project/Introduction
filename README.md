# Introduction
#Introduction to The PERMIT project

There are clear guidelines for the treatment of heart failure, which include the use of diuretics at some point during the treatment pathway. However, these guidelines do not cover when and how frequently patients with heart failure should have their renal function monitored largely because there is no good evidence to indicate optimum frequency in given circumstances. The PERMIT prohect is developing personalised kidney function monitoring guidelines based on the characteristics of individual patients. These protocols are designed to update clinical care pathways, and potentially reduce hospital admissions, reduce cost and improve patient quality of life. 

To generate this personalised guidance system, electronic health care databases have been used to identify heart failure patients with varying characteristics. Patient data from these patients has been used to follow renal function over the course of heart failure diagnosis and subsequent follow-up care. These data were collated and examined in detail to provide indicators of how often monitoring is needed based on individual patient characteristics. 

This research has been carried out collaboratively at the University of Liverpool at the Institute of Translational Medicine, The Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry and The Health eResearch Centre at The University of Manchester. This project has been funded by the National Institute of Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care North West Coast (NIHR CLAHRC NWC).

#Resources for analysis
The repositories shared here include lists of codes and R programming codes used to process and analyse electronic patient data from the Salford Integrated Record (SIR) and Clinical Practise Research Datalink (CPRD). 

For queries on operationalising any of these programming codes please contact Dunja Kurtoic at: or Paolo Fraccaro at: 
For queries relating to SIR or CPRD data, please contact Salford CCG or CPRD directly.
